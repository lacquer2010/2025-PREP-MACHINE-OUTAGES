Outage Planner (host-ready)

Two zero-code hosting options:

A) Netlify Drop (fastest)
1) Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2) Drag the entire 'site' folder onto the page.
3) Netlify gives you a public https:// URL immediately.
4) Open that URL: everything will be fully interactive.

B) GitHub Pages (company-friendly)
1) Create a new GitHub repo (public or internal).
2) Upload the contents of the 'site' folder (index.html and README.txt) to the repo root.
3) In the repo Settings â†’ Pages, set "Deploy from a branch", branch = main, folder = /root.
4) GitHub publishes it at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/

Notes
- This is a single-file web app (index.html). No build step, no dependencies.
- The app stores edits in your browser's localStorage per user (Eric will have his own saved state).
- Export month as printable HTML to print or save as PDF.
- You can import/export placements via CSV in the Tools panel.

If you need the app preloaded with a 2025 schedule, provide a placements CSV with columns:
year,month,date,slot,title,bg,font
e.g. 2025,1,2025-01-15,AM,QUAD RUN,#b1a0c7,#000000
Then use 'Import placements CSV' in the app.
